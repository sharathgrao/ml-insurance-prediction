# ML-Insurance-Prediction


## Introduction to problem
The insurance industry makes money by charging a premium to the customer against a particular amount of cover. There are different types of insurance products like life insurance, general insurance, car insurance, mobile insurance, health insurance and many more. A particular customer can have one or more of these products.
 
For insurance markets to work well, insurance companies need to be able to pool and spread risk across a broad customer base. This works best where the population to be insured is diverse and large. 
 
Understanding the varied insurance needs of a population, and matching them to appropriate products offered by insurance companies makes insurance more effective and makes insurance companies more successful. The other thing that makes the insurance company successful is deciding the correct premium for the customer as each customer is unique.
